Name: Shriya Kumari
Module: Dynamic Programming
Learnings: I learned how to break complex problems into smaller sub-problems and solve them efficiently. The concept of storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations helped in optimizing both time and space. This approach is especially useful in problems involving recursion and overlapping substructures.
